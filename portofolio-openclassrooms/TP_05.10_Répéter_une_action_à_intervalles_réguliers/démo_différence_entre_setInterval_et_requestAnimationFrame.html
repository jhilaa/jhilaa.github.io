    <title>Démo de la différence entre setInterval et requestAnimationFrame</title>
    <!-----------------------------
        The requestAnimationFrame method is used to sync animations with the screen updates. The screen updates at a specific rate, for example 60 times per second. If you sync your animation updates so that they occur at that rate, the animation will look smooth.

        You can make the setInterval run more often to make it a bit smoother, but to make it support all different screens you would have to make it run faster than 120 times per second, which uses a lot more CPU than needed for most screens, and some browsers doesn't even support a rate that fast.

        Here is an example, where anim1 runs at the rate of the screen, while anim2 runs at a fixed rate. If you run the demo, you see that the left square moves smoothly, while the right square jumps a bit in the movement.

        Note some differences:

        anim1 calls requestAnimationFrame to catch the next update.
        anim1 gets a parameter to use for timing, while anim2 uses a counter.

        Also, note that setInterval is supported in all browsers, but requestAnimationFrame is not. Internet Explorer 9 for example does not support it. If you plan to use it, it would be a good idea to check if it exists first, and use setInterval as a fallback.

        function anim1(t1) {
            a1.style.left = (50 + Math.cos(t1 / 500) * 30) + 'px';
            a1.style.top = (50 + Math.sin(t1 / 500) * 30) + 'px';
            window.requestAnimationFrame(anim1);
        }

        function anim2() {
            a2.style.left = (100 + Math.cos(t2) * 30) + 'px';
            a2.style.top = (50 + Math.sin(t2) * 30) + 'px';
            t2 += 0.055;
